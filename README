It's a "reverse shield" to make a TV-B-Gone under a Boarduino.

See our wiki about this at : http://wiki.fabelier.org/index.php?title=TVBGone

This branch is about the same shield made with a stripboard. It's cheaper and does need less tools.

The fzz file is made with Fritzing app. It's free.
Other files are form KiCad (free too).
